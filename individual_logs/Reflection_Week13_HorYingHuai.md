## Reflection

# Week 13 Reflection

**1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?**
Identifying the critical path is vital because it reveals exactly where delays will impact the final deadline. In your Week 08 Progress Tracking, the team identified that the "Critical Path is currently delayed by roughly 1 week" due to the dependencies between Model Training (Task 4.1/4.2) and Evaluation (Task 5.1). Knowing this allowed the team to see that Task 5.1 couldn't start until Task 4.2 was fully complete.

**2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?**
Activity E (Model Training & Fine-Tuning). According to your Risk Register, "Intent model fails to reach 90% accuracy" (Risk R2) is the highest rated risk (Score: 20). Additionally, in the Week 08 reflection, Fareen noted that "training outcomes are inherently unpredictable," making the fixed duration for this task "overly optimistic".

**3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?**
The main trade-off is Cost vs. Scope/Quality. In your Week 08 Corrective Actions, the team discussed "Reallocation of Human Resources" to fix delays in Model Training. The trade-off was moving resources away from "lower-risk tasks" (like documentation), which effectively sacrifices the quality or speed of non-critical tasks to save the critical path. You also noted that to control costs, you might have to refine the scope (e.g., drop advanced features) to stay within the RM 1,005 budget.
