# Week 13 Reflection

**1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?**
Identifying the critical path is important because it helps project managers determine which activities directly affect the project completion date. In this project, all activities such as AI model training, Telegram bot integration, and system testing are on the critical path. Any delay in these tasks would delay the entire project. Knowing the critical path allows the project manager to prioritize resources, monitor progress closely, and take corrective action early when delays occur.

**2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?**
The activity that posed the highest scheduling risk was model training and fine-tuning. This task depends heavily on data quality, model performance, and computational resources. Unexpected issues such as poor training accuracy or limited processing power could increase the time required, which would directly impact subsequent activities like system integration and testing.

**3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?**
Crashing a project can reduce the overall project duration, but it involves several trade-offs. Additional resources such as cloud computing services or extra team effort may increase project costs. There is also a risk of reduced quality if tasks are completed too quickly. Therefore, project managers must carefully balance time, cost, and quality when deciding whether crashing is appropriate.
