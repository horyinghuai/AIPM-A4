## Reflection

### 1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?
Identifying the critical path is vital because it dictates the **shortest possible duration** for the entire project. Tasks on this path have **zero float** (slack), meaning any delay in these specific activities will directly delay the project's final deadline. By knowing which tasks are critical, I can focus my management efforts and resources effectively, ensuring that the most time-sensitive parts of the project are not neglected while avoiding micromanaging non-critical tasks that have flexible buffers.

### 2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?
The activity on the critical path with the highest uncertainty posed the greatest risk—in our AI context, this was **Model Training**. Unlike standard development tasks where time estimates are stable, training can fail, diverge, or require unexpected re-runs, yet because it sits on the critical path, we have no buffer time (zero float) to accommodate these issues. This makes it the highest-risk activity because a technical hiccup here immediately jeopardizes the project delivery date.

### 3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?
Crashing a project involves shortening the schedule by adding resources, which creates a primary trade-off between **Time and Cost**. While we gain time (finish earlier), we almost always incur higher costs due to overtime pay, hiring additional staff, or paying for premium computational resources (like faster GPUs). Additionally, there is often a secondary trade-off with **Quality or Risk**; rushing tasks or adding too many people ("too many cooks in the kitchen") can lead to communication breakdowns and increased error rates.
