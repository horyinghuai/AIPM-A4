## Reflection

# Week 09 Reflection

**1. Why is identifying the critical path important for project managers?**
Identifying the critical path helps project managers understand which tasks directly affect the project completion date. If any task on this path is delayed, the whole project will be delayed, so these tasks must be closely monitored and prioritised.

**2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?**
The activity with the highest scheduling risk was Model Training and Fine-Tuning. This task carried high uncertainty because the model’s performance depended on training results, which made it difficult to accurately estimate the time needed.

**3. What trade-offs are involved when crashing a project?**
Crashing a project often involves increasing cost or reducing quality to meet deadlines. Extra resources may be added to critical tasks, but this can affect other non-critical activities or require reducing project scope to stay within budget.
